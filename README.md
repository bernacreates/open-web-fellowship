# ✨ Opscientia Open Web Fellowship 🎓
The Opscientia Open Web Fellowship is a 12-week program that provides a stipend for talented undergraduates, students, and post-doctoral scholars to work on open source software development and basic research that aligns with the Opscientia mission.

Fellows must submit a proposal for review with a detailed problem statement, solution, plan of execution, and timeline for their software development project. Mentors may work with applicants to help them prepare their proposal. Selected projects will receive continued mentorship through weekly check-ins, performance review, and code review to help fellows approach milestones in their development timeline.

## 👩‍🚀 Opscientia Mission
Opscientia PTE. LTD. is a legal entity founded to support the growth of a self-sustaining decentralized science community. We’re a community of science activists, researchers, organisers and enthusiasts that have come together to work on the problems of data sharing, reproducibility, incentive alignment, coordination, and intellectual ownership that plague knowledge creation today.

Our 10 year goal is to build the tools required for a digital space where anyone, anywhere, can launch a laboratory to conduct ethical scienctific research and contribute to a repository of autonomous workflows for knowledge creation. Opscientia is developing solutions to address the following problems in scientific research today:

### ☁️ Cloud Services
- Equal-access repositories for scientific data storage (public science commons) (decentralised / maintained)
- Equitable & secure access to cloud services for resource-intensive computation on Big Data
- Permanent content-addressable links to important scientific knowledge

### 👩‍🏫 Semantic Web of Science
- Integration of scientific standards for reporting, sharing, with inter-linked metadata
- Open real-time collaboration & feedback (peer review at every step)
- Contribution tracking & notarisation of scientific discovery

### 🌀 Token Communities
- Alternative outcome metrics for researcher success to inform funding mechanisms
- Incentives for mentorship as reputation metrics
- Multi-agent modeling for self-sustaining communities through aligned incentive + value creation feedback loops
